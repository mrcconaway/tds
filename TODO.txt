Todo:

1) Add a shoot timer such that player cannot shoot infinitely fast (add firerate)
2) Add a way for mutliple weapons
3) See if you can refactor bullets
    * Don't let bullets hit multiple enemies
    * Get target ID and check against those target ids already hit
    * Allow for penetration among enemies
4) Need to add unique target IDs
